# Python Trending Weekly 40 (2024-03-02)

Welcome to the Python Trending Weekly, a weekly newsletter about Python, AI and general programming techniques, with the majority links in English and a small portion in Chinese. 

The [original version](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2024-03-02-weekly) of the weekly was written in Chinese. What you are reading here is mostly translated by LLMs.

## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [The White House recommends the use of memory-safe languages such as Python](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/white-house-recommends-.html)

A report released last year by agencies including CISA and NSA listed C#, Go, Java, **Python**, Rust, and Swift as memory-safe languages. This PSF article discusses Python's work on memory safety, including sandboxing the underlying code, migrating from C to Rust, and using compiler options to harden the C code builds.

2. [A Retrospective on Requests](https://blog.ian.stapletoncordas.co/2024/02/a-retrospective-on-requests)

The author of the article is one of the core maintainers of Requests. He listed several places where the library did poorly and also pointed out many reasons why he wanted to improve it but didn't. The epilogue says: "the project feels dead". It's heartbreaking. This weekly [issue 26](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-11-11-weekly) shared an apology from KR, the author of the library. However, there was little response in the community. Later, I saw that KR lost his job, and I felt even worse from the tweet that he was in a bad mental state. (Contributed by @frostming90)

3. [Python's UV Tool Is Actually Pretty Good](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/29/pythons-uv-tool.html)

Last issue, we shared the `uv` library, which can replace `pip`. Have you used it? How do you feel about it? The author of the article gave positive feedback and shared some before-and-after comparisons of his configuration files.

4. [Python Generators Are Underutilized](https://www.slashtmp.io/posts/generators/)

Python generators are useful for saving memory. This article uses clear examples to compare the memory usage of two different approaches, allowing us to appreciate the benefits of generators. Additionally, the article highlights some usage pitfalls to avoid.

5. [Advanced Web Scraping With Python: Extract Data From Any Site](https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/advanced-web-scraping-techniques)

This article discusses some advanced techniques for scraping the web, including topics such as how to better handle cookies and custom request headers, what TLS fingerprinting is and how to avoid it, common HTTP request headers to be aware of, how to integrate exponential backoff retries when making HTTP requests, and more.

6. [Django REST Framework and Vue versus Django and HTMX](https://testdriven.io/blog/drf-vue-vs-django-htmx/)

How are two combinations of web development frameworks used, and what are their advantages and disadvantages? This article implements the same functionality with these two combinations, analyzes the differences between the two technology stacks, and provides a comparison checklist to help us make better technology choices.

7. [The Road to Composable Data Systems: Thoughts on the Last 15 Years and the Future](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/looking-back-15-years/)

This article is written by Wes McKinney, the author of the `pandas` library and the book *Python for Data Analysis*. He reviews what he has done and the changes he has made in the field of data science since 2008, and analyzes and thinks about the future trends of modularity, interoperability, and composability.

8. [Django SQLite Benchmark](https://blog.pecar.me/django-sqlite-benchmark)

The author benchmarked SQLite with different major configurations and also compared the performance between SQLite and PostgreSQL. In short, enabling WAL mode, using IMMEDIATE transactions, `synchronous=NORMAL`, and memory-mapped I/O have little impact on the throughput.

9. [How Python 3.13's JIT Is Implemented](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/682997904)

The article introduces how Python's latest JIT is implemented, and the author tried to install the development version and then compared its performance with the version without JIT. Currently, the performance of the JIT version is slower than the normal version, and the official team still needs to continue to optimize it.

10. [Web Scraping in Python - The Complete Guide](https://proxiesapi.com/articles/web-scraping-in-python-the-complete-guide)

A detailed tutorial on web scraping, introducing how to use libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium to achieve web scraping, and how to overcome challenges like complex web pages, rate limiting, anti-scraping, and dynamic JavaScript.

11. [In Defense of Simple Architectures](https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/)

Wave is a company with only 70 engineers but valued at $1.7 billion. Its product is just a standard CRUD application, built on a Python monolith architecture on top of Postgres. The article explains why they chose such an architecture, the rationality of such a choice, and the related challenges they overcame and the technical solutions they adopted in order to maintain it.

12. [Scheduling Internals](https://tontinton.com/posts/scheduling-internals/)

A very in-depth and long article that delves into "concurrency", explaining how a single-threaded server can handle millions of tasks through asynchronous IO and event-driven programming. It discusses various approaches and tools for implementing concurrency, and the implementations in different programming languages. The article contains many animations to help readers understand.
