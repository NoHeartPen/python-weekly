1. [CPython Contributions Diary: What's New in Python 3.12](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/634654153)

This article was written by my friend @Sun Mengyue. It introduces several major updates in Python 3.12 that he was deeply involved in, such as PEP-701 finalizing the syntax of f-strings, PEP-688 exposing the Python Buffer Protocol to the Python interface, and PEP-695 type parameter syntax. In addition, in his previous article [CPython Contributions Diary](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/623602662), he introduced relevant knowledge about contributing to open source communities, such as tips for submitting PRs and tips for submitting/resolving Issues.
