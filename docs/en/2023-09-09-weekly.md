PEP-703 is a proposal for the no-gil project, which we have introduced many times. The author discusses some topics in this PEP, such as minimizing reliance on atomic reference counting, lazy reference counting, gc will no longer be generational, object locks, etc. From this, we can see the trade-offs that the Python community makes in terms of performance and compatibility.

3. [Writing a C Compiler in 500 Lines of Python](https://vgel.me/posts/c500/)

How many lines of Python code does it take to implement a C compiler? This article introduces the architecture of the compiler, the code parsing and generation process, and attempts to implement a simple C compiler in 500 lines of code.

4. [An Intro to Protocol Buffers with Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/08/30/an-intro-to-protocol-buffers-with-python)

Protocol buffers are a language-neutral data serialization format, similar to Python's pickle format. This article introduces how to create and compile protocol buffer files with Python and communicate with other languages that support the protocol.

5. [How to Create a Beautiful Polar Histogram with Python and Matplotlib](https://dev.to/oscarleo/how-to-create-a-beautiful-polar-histogram-with-python-and-matplotlib-400l)

A polar histogram is a type of chart used to visualize and analyze the distribution of data. It divides the data into sectors, with the length or area of each sector representing the frequency or quantity of data within that angular range. This article explains how to create a polar histogram in Python.

6. [Bloom Filter Diagram and Python Implementation](https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/bloom-filters-and-beyond)

Bloom Filter is a data structure that can be used to quickly determine whether an element is in a set. Use cases include: deduplication, caching and fast lookups, preventing cache penetration, and filtering spam. The article introduces what it is, how it works, Python implementation, how to tune Bloom Filter, etc.

7. [Heap Data Structure in Python: Min and Max Heap Implementation](https://favtutor.com/blogs/heap-in-python)

Heap is an essential data structure that is often used for fast access to extreme values, heapsort, scheduling and task allocation, graph algorithms, data compression and encoding, etc. The article introduces its basic concepts, how to implement a max heap and a min heap in Python, and the differences between them.

8. [Beginner's Guide to Python Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/09/05/beginners-guide-python-containers)

Containers are a lightweight virtualization technology that enable efficient packaging and deployment of Python applications. This tutorial from Red Hat shows you how to build, run, and manage Python containers using **Podman**.

9. [A Practical Guide to Python Packaging in 2023](https://robamu.github.io/posts/packaging-python-in-2023/)

This article summarizes some of the best practices that are currently applicable when managing Python packages, such as using pyproject.toml, using setuptools as a distribution and build tool, writing documentation with Sphinx + reStructuredText + sphinx-rtd-theme, listing version changes with CHANGELOG, and using black and flake8, among others.

10. [Tracking Down a Python Application Memory Leak](https://juejin.cn/post/7274626136328536116)

The author uses Airflow as a task scheduler, and after going live, the Scheduler memory OOM issue appears every once in a while. This article provides a detailed account of the process of locating and analyzing the problem. Three tools are introduced: **objgraph, pympler, tracemalloc**.

11. [Introducing flake8-logging](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/09/07/introducing-flake8-logging/)

The author believes that the standard library `logging` is relatively difficult to use, and that necessary logs are often missing when a program errors out, so the flake8-logging plugin was developed. It has 12 rules, and this article introduces 3 of them: instantiating a logger using logging.getLogger(), using exception() when handling exceptions, and avoiding pre-formatting log messages.

12. [Falcon 180B is Now Officially Released on Hugging Face Hub](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000044189692)

As the largest open-source large model to date, Falcon has 180B parameters and was trained on the TII RefinedWeb dataset with 35 trillion tokens, making it the longest single-segment pre-training among current open-source models. The article introduces its advantages and how to get started with it.
