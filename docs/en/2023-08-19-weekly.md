5. [How Does CPython Implement Reference Counting?](https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/cpython-reference-counting-internals)

Are you curious about the underlying workings and internal structures of CPython? This article delves into the source code to explain how CPython implements reference counting and memory management. It covers the mechanics of reference counting, explains key data structures, explores the execution of bytecode instructions, and discusses the limitations of reference counting.

6. [Python Lazy Loading with Importlib](https://coderslegacy.com/python-lazy-loading-with-importlib/)

Lazy loading refers to importing modules when they are needed, rather than when the program starts. Its advantages include reduced startup time, lower memory consumption, improved performance, optimized resource utilization, and runtime loading. This article introduces the usage of `importlib` to achieve lazy loading.

7. [End-to-End Testing with Python and Playwright](https://sixfeetup.com/blog/end-to-end-testing-python-playwright)

8. [The nogil and Faster CPython projects](https://lwn.net/Articles/939981/)

Although the Python official has announced that it will accept **PEP-703**, the final version may have to wait until version 3.17, five years later. Since 2021, the nogil and Faster CPython projects have continued to attract attention. This article reviews their development over the past two years, some key issues handling schemes and important progress, and recent responses from the community and large companies. (Attached: [Python's first workshop on nogil](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2021-11-14-GIL), [Faster CPython project debuts](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2021-05-16-Guido))

10. [Why You Should Avoid Using "import *" in Python](https://pybit.es/articles/why-you-should-avoid-import-in-python/)

A file in Python is a module, which has its own namespace. When using "import *", it leads to "**namespace pollution**"! The article points out the correct way to follow the PEP-8 style, and also suggests that `__all__` should be used to define the variable names that can be exported in the module.

11. [Let's End Python's Dependency Hell](https://prefix.dev/blog/launching_pixi)

13. [Speed Up Your Django App: 7 Tips for Faster Database Queries](https://johnnymetz.com/posts/slow-django-database-queries/)

Database queries are one of the major factors that affect the performance of web applications. This article introduces 7 tips to improve performance: set a timeout for query execution, use `assertNumQueries` to test the number of queries, use `nplusone` to catch N+1 queries, use `django-zen-queries` to catch N+1 queries, avoid making new queries on prefetched objects, use `defer()` to prevent fetching large unused fields, and avoid using `distinct()` on large fields.

14. [Weird Python "Features" That Might Surprise You](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/103)

Sometimes we see some strange phenomena in programming languages. They may be some very unpopular "features", or they may be mistaken for bugs or cause bugs due to misunderstanding. The author introduces several of his small discoveries.

15. [How Khan Academy Rewrote Their Python Backend in Go](https://blog.quastor.org/p/khan-academy-rewrote-backend)

Khan Academy used Python as its main language for 10 years, but around 2020, it completely switched to Go. This article introduces why and how it refactored the entire Python 2 backend to Go services. The article cites a series of summary blogs from Khan Academy, which can be used for further reading.

16. [Why Static Languages Suffer from Complexity](https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity.html#the-unfortunate-consequences-of-being-static)

This is a long article about how programming languages should be designed! The author points out that modern programming languages have the problem of "**static-dynamic polymorphism**", and proposes that an ideal programming language should have both static and dynamic features. The article analyzes the practices of two languages, **Idris** and **Zig**, and points out their limitations. Finally, it proposes that programming languages should be rethought.
