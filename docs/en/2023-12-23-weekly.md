## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [How many CPUs can actually be used in parallel programs?](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/cpu-thread-pool-size/)

In CPU-intensive tasks, the size of the thread/process pool is usually set according to the number of CPU cores. But how do you determine how many CPUs are actually best to use? What are physical and logical CPUs? How do you test how many CPUs are appropriate to set?

2. [Where Do Your Python Packages Go?](https://frostming.com/2019/03-13/where-do-your-packages-go/)

Python beginners often encounter package-related issues, one of the main reasons being that they are not clear about how Python finds packages. This article introduces the order in which Python searches for packages, how it installs packages, the role of virtual environments, and how the way a script is run affects the search path.

3. [Removing C API functions from CPython](https://vstinner.github.io/remove-c-api-funcs-313.html)

Victor Stinner, a prolific core developer, removed over 300 private C API functions in Python 3.13 alpha 1, received some negative feedback, and restored 50 of them in alpha 2. The post documents what he did and the feedback he got from the community.

4. [Python Gotcha: The Problem with Copying Lists](https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-list-copy.html)

How do you create a copy of a mutable object like a list? For one-dimensional lists, the article introduces three methods; however, for two-dimensional lists, the issue of shallow copy versus deep copy arises, and **copy.deepcopy()** must be used. (Note: The author's "**Python Gotcha** " series of short articles introduces some usage considerations for Python.)

5. [Best Practices for asyncio Task Cancellation](https://superfastpython.com/asyncio-task-cancellation-best-practices/)

Asyncio tasks can be canceled manually or automatically. This article introduces six best practices and provides corresponding examples.

6. [Configuration in Python applications: no magic, just necessary practice](https://robertrode.com/2023/10/02/configuration-in-python-applications-no-magic-just-necessary-practice.html)

How can we store mutable or sensitive parameters in a configuration file? We can use files like ini, json, toml, yaml, or environment variables. When should we initialize the configuration? How can we modify the configuration during tests? This article shares some usage tips.

7. [Fine-tuning Flask, Django, and FastAPI applications in Python](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/fine-tuning-wsgi-and-asgi-applications.html)

This article introduces some best practices for configuring your web server (involving Gunicorn, Uvicorn, and Hypercorn). It covers the differences between the ASGI and WSGI standards, how to set the number of workers and threads, how to use tools like Locust for testing, and which approach to use for different web frameworks.

8. [Why Do Python, Go, and Rust Not Support the Ternary Operator?](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-04-03-condition)

Python does not support the ternary operator, but it has a very special **conditional selection syntax**. Why is it designed this way? The article sorts out the tortuous syntax design story of Python, and at the same time introduces the coincidental practices of Go and Rust, which makes people think about what is better syntax design in programming languages?

9. [The Key to the `key` Parameter in Python](https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/the-key-to-the-key-parameter-in-python)

You may have seen the `key` parameter in the `sorted()` and `list.sort()` functions, but it is also available in many other functions, such as `max()` and `min()`. This article explains how to use the `key` parameter in these functions.

10. [Eliminating Mutating Methods from Python Data Classes](https://rednafi.com/python/dataclasses_and_methods/)

In Python, you can use the `@dataclass` decorator to define data classes, which automatically add magic methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`, reducing the amount of code you need to write. The author recommends defining immutable data classes and avoiding mutating their attributes like you would with a regular class. If you need to use methods like `__repr__` in a regular class, it is better to implement them manually.
