## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [AsyncIO](https://charlesleifer.com/blog/asyncio) (English)

The author of the article dislikes the asyncio library, believing that the design using `async` and `await` is very bad, it is incompatible with most libraries, and it does not meet some of the standards of the "Zen of Python". The author's recommended solution is gevent, mentioning its advantages. In addition, the author also recommends two related articles: Flask author Armin Ronacher's [I don't understand Python's Asyncio](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/10/30/i-dont-understand-asyncio), and SQLAlchemy author Mike Bayer's [Asynchronous Python and Databases](https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/).

2. [What the Heck is Gevent?](https://eng.lyft.com/what-the-heck-is-gevent-4e87db98a8)

Gevent is a cooperative multitasking Python framework based on coroutines, using monkey patching to patch all code. This post is the first in a series introducing the basic implementation details of gevent, followed by [Gevent Correctness](https://eng.lyft.com/gevent-part-2-correctness-22e3b7998382) and [Gevent Performance](https://eng.lyft.com/gevent-part-3-performance-e64303fa102b).

3. [Getting Started with ReactPy](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/06/getting-started-reactpy.html) (EN)

ReactPy, which was recommended in the last issue of the newsletter, has recently become very popular. It supports writing React-style front-end applications in Python. Here is a simple getting started tutorial. In addition, we recommend that interested students read the [official documentation](https://reactpy.dev/docs/guides/getting-started/index.html).

4. [Some Thoughts on Circular Dependency and Global Contexts in Python Business Frameworks](https://qin.news/python-circular-dependency-and-global-contexts)

How can we solve the circular dependency problem in Python simply and elegantly? The author examined the context management schemes of mainstream API frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI), and then introduced the scheme adopted by his own framework: borrowing the concept of object ownership in the Ray community, a simple ownership dictionary is implemented on a coroutine.

5. [Practical Dependency Tracking for Python Function Calls](https://amakelov.github.io/blog/deps)

Tracking the code and data accessed during a Python function call can be useful for operations like drawing dependency graphs, debugging and profiling performance, and invalidating caches. This article explores one possible implementation, including a minimal working implementation in fewer than 100 lines of code. The author is a PhD in Computer Science from MIT.

6. [Python 3.x From Basics to Practice - Typing Type Hints](https://juejin.cn/post/7244033665209073725)

9. [7 Ways to Share Numpy Arrays Between Processes](https://superfastpython.com/numpy-share-array-processes)

One of the trickiest things in multiprocessing is sharing data. This post introduces 7 ways to share Numpy arrays: passing arguments, using global variables, using the Queue, using the Pipe, using RawArray based on ctypes, using SharedMemory from Python 3.8, and using the manager from multiprocessing. This is a systematic and long article, which also cites some related articles by the author. It is highly recommended.

Guess what the final conclusion is?

13. [Streaming with FastAPI](https://www.vidavolta.io/streaming-with-fastapi)

Server-Sent Events is a one-way HTTP-based communication protocol that allows a server to push data to clients in real time. This article explains how to implement streaming JSON events using FastAPI. This article is from the "FastAPI Pro Series". The other two articles are about [how to use dynamic configuration](https://www.vidavolta.io/dynamically-configure-python-apps-fastapi) and [how to secure your API with API keys](https://www.vidavolta.io/fastapi-api-keys).

15. [CPython Adds RETURN\_CONST Instruction](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101632)

Last week's newsletter sparked a discussion on "the number of Chinese Python contributors". @yihong0618 shared this contribution to CPython by @penguin-wwy on Twitter. The author found that LOAD\_CONST + RETURN\_VALUE appears frequently in the pystats documentation, so he submitted a new RETURN\_CONST instruction. This contribution resulted in a performance improvement of about 10% in the Python 3.12 benchmark.
