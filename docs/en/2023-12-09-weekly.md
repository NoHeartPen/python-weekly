## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Python Africa: An Open Letter to the Python Software Foundation](https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html)

An open letter to the PSF from Python community organizers in over a dozen African countries. The letter was prompted by the PSF's delayed disbursement of a $9,000 grant to Africa's first DjangoCon, and it highlights other issues within the PSF, including racism, lack of attention to marginalized groups, and non-compliance with local laws. (As an aside, the PSF gave 1% of its grants to Asia in 2022, compared to 16% to Africa...)

2. [Django 5.0 Released!](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/releases/5.0)

Django 5.0 was released this week, and it only supports Python 3.10 and later. Key new features: The new `Field.db_default` parameter allows you to set a default value that is calculated by the database; `GeneratedField` allows you to create columns that are generated by the database; Field groups and field group templates have been introduced, which simplify the rendering of related elements for form fields. (Bonus: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPl5Q5gv9G8) introducing new features in Django)

3. [56 Lines of Python Code to Implement a Flex/Lex](https://www.skywind.me/blog/archives/2761)

Lex/Flex can be used to generate lexical analyzers that process lexical structures in source code. The author implemented a general rule-based lexical analyzer by modifying a program in the official Python documentation, which can be used to handle simple lexical analysis requirements.

4. [How to Use Dependency Injection in FastAPI the Right Way](https://so1n.me/2023/12/07/how-to-use-dependency-injection-in-fastapi/)

This article points out two wrong ways people use dependency injection in FastAPI and introduces how to implement dependency injection in FastAPI using `python-dependency-injector`.

5. [Why You Should Not Overuse List Comprehensions in Python](https://www.kdnuggets.com/why-you-should-not-overuse-list-comprehensions-in-python)

Using list comprehensions appropriately can make your code more concise and elegant, but overusing them will severely impair the readability of your code. The author provides three examples, each implemented with list comprehensions and a conventional approach, allowing readers to appreciate how easy-to-understand code is superior to fancy showmanship.

6. [Untyped Python: The Python That Was](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/12/1/the-python-that-was/)

In his latest post, Armin Ronacher, the creator of Flask, discusses the topic of types in Python. The central thesis is that Python's dynamic typing is an advantage due to its inherent philosophy, which clashes with typing. Typing has its merits, but it also comes with a cost. The author reminisces about the Python of the past.

7. [Add Full-Text Search to Your Django Project with django-watson](https://idiomaticprogrammers.com/post/django-watson-full-text-search-guide)

A very detailed tutorial on adding full-text search capabilities to your Django project using [django-watson](https://github.com/etianen/django-watson) and PostgreSQL. The library supports searching across multiple models and sorting by relevance. (star 1.2K)

8. [Celery Fanout Pattern Explained](https://www.better-simple.com/django/2023/12/06/fanout-pattern-explained/)

The Celery fanout pattern is a task distribution pattern where a single task triggers multiple child tasks to be executed in parallel. The author introduces a practical use case of this pattern, arguing that it is a good way to implement dynamic workflows in task signatures.

9. [7 Alternatives to Python Asyncio](https://superfastpython.com/asyncio-alternatives/)

Asyncio is Python's standard library for asynchronous programming, but it's not your only option. This article introduces and compares seven alternatives, including older libraries like Tornado, Twisted, and Gevent, as well as newer ones like Curio, Trio, AnyIO, and UVloop.

10. [Inside CPython: What Happens When You Do a+b?](https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/cpython-dynamic-dispatch-internals)

A deep dive into the inner workings of CPython's dynamic dispatch mechanism. Dynamic dispatch is the process of determining which method or function to call at runtime (rather than at compile time). Something as simple as a+b can have multiple combinations of types, and the actual computation can be quite different.

11. [How to Display an Animated GIF with Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/12/05/viewing-an-animated-gif-with-python/)

GIF is an image format that supports animation without audio. Are there any Python libraries that can display animated GIFs programmatically? This article introduces three approaches using tkinter, PySimpleGUI, and Jupyter Notebook.

12. [Building a Simple REPL in Python](https://bernsteinbear.com//blog/simple-python-repl/)

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive environment for a programming language. Python's standard library includes a code module that provides the functionality to implement a REPL. This article demonstrates how to build a simple REPL by incrementally introducing requirements.
