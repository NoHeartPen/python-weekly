## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Three Ways to Benchmark Python Code](https://superfastpython.com/benchmark-python-code/)

This article introduces several methods for benchmarking Python using the standard library: time, timeit, cProfile, and profile. It provides detailed instructions on how to use these tools and how to interpret the test data.

2. [Ditch Poetry and PDM, Switch to Hatch](https://andrich.me/2023/08/switching-to-hatch/)

The author "fell in love" with Hatch and started using it in his projects. The article introduces some of the highlights he likes about Hatch: environment isolation, command scripts, an alternative to **Tox**, optional dependencies, and more. (See also: [Python Task Automation Tool Tox Tutorial](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2020-01-06-tox))

3. [What's wrong with TOML?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/toml/)

TOML is an "improved" INI file and is the recommended configuration file format for Python. The article mentions that even the author of TOML thinks it's a terrible format! The article points out its problems: it's very verbose, the hierarchy is hard to infer from the syntax alone, it's unnecessarily complex like YAML, and it has a type system.

4. [Playing with Genetic Algorithms in Python](https://joseprupi.github.io/misc/2023/08/19/playing_with_genetic_algorithms_in_python.html)

Genetic Algorithm is an optimization algorithm inspired by the theory of biological evolution, used to solve complex search and optimization problems. The article demonstrates the usage of this algorithm with Python.

5. [Type Hinting in Modern Python: The Protocol Class](https://codebeez.nl/blogs/type-hinting-in-modern-python-the-protocol-class/)

The Protocol class was introduced in Python 3.8 to specify which methods a class should implement, similar to an Interface in Java. Using a Protocol allows for some static type checking while still maintaining Python's dynamic typing.

6. [Tornado's Coroutine Scheduling Principle](https://dev.to/caipi/tornado-de-xie-cheng-diao-du-yuan-li-2h34)

Tornado is a high-performance web framework. This article analyzes its source code, mainly to figure out: where does the state of `yield` go, what exactly is the "right time" to resume execution, and how exactly is execution resumed?

7. [Visualizing the CPython Release Process](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-9)

Based on PEP-101, this article combs through the CPython release process, draws a detailed flowchart, and provides explanations for key steps.

8. [How to Use PyObjC with Apple's Vision Framework for Text Recognition](https://yasoob.me/posts/how-to-use-vision-framework-via-pyobjc/)

Apple's Vision framework provides a set of pretrained models and APIs to quickly add image analysis and computer vision capabilities to your apps. PyObjC enables Python to interact with Objective-C. This article combines them to develop a text processing project.

9. [Regex Catastrophic Backtracking in Python](https://krishnanchandra.com/posts/regex-catastrophic-backtracking/)

The author used py-spy to locate a CPU 100% usage issue, found the culprit regular expression, and then explored catastrophic backtracking, its solutions, and suggested a better way to write it for performance.

10. [Building a Database Search App with Django and HTMX](https://www.photondesigner.com/articles/database-search-django-htmx)

A detailed Django project tutorial that implements a full-stack project. The article includes a video tutorial by the author.

11. [Asynchronous SQLAlchemy and Multiple Databases](https://python-bloggers.com/2023/09/asynchronous-sqlalchemy-and-multiple-databases/)

Utilizing asyncio and the SQLAlchemy library, the article explores how to efficiently connect to and manage multiple databases, achieving a scalable and resilient architecture. Two implementation approaches are presented.

12. [Python Fire: Generate Command-Line Interfaces Automatically](https://juejin.cn/post/7278246015193464847)

Fire is a library for generating CLIs, open-sourced by Google with 25K stars on Github. This article introduces its usage, including general commands, composite commands, chained commands, complex commands, and more.

13. [My Favorite Python Tricks for Solving LeetCode Problems](https://www.jjinux.com/2022/08/python-my-favorite-python-tricks-for.html)

The article introduces some Python tricks, from beginner to advanced levels, mostly related to data structures, which are useful when solving LeetCode problems.

14. [Why Does Python Code Run Faster in a Function?](https://stackabuse.com/why-does-python-code-run-faster-in-a-function/)

Python code is executed either in a function or in a global module. Which one is faster? Why is it faster in a function? How does Python code work under the hood? How to test and optimize the performance of Python functions?
