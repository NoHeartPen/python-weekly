## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Python Packaging, One Year Later: A Look Back at 2023 in Python Packaging](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/)

A year ago, the author complained about the miserable state of Python packaging. A year later, has anything improved? Or has it gotten worse? The article discusses the mainstream packaging tools in the community, the PEP standards and their implementation. Although there are many new things, it still seems bleak.

2. [All PyCon 2023 (US and AU) talks sorted by the view count](https://techtalksweekly.substack.com/p/all-pycon-2023-talks-sorted-by-views)

This article organizes 243 videos from last year's PyCon US and Python AU, sorted by the number of views on YouTube. None of them have many views, and the gap between the first and second place is huge.

3. [Synchronized in Python](https://thiagowfx.github.io/2024/01/synchronized-in-python/)

In Java, the `synchronized` keyword can be used to ensure that a variable is thread-safe. Is there anything in Python that can achieve the same effect? This article introduces the implementationÊñπÊ°à of the `threading` module's Lock + context manager + decorator.

4. [Type information for faster Python C extensions](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/typed-c-extensions/)

PyPy is a Python interpreter with a compatibility layer for its C API that has some performance problems. The author is working on ways to make PyPy's C API faster, and this post describes the work that they have done.

5. [Comparing coroutines, by example, in Kotlin and Python](https://medium.com/@ms.carmen.alvarez/comparing-coroutines-by-example-in-kotlin-and-python-7e60746eae18)

The author has been exposed to coroutines while developing with Python and Kotlin, so she wrote several articles to compare their usage, analyze their details and working principles, covering file reading and writing, HTTP requests, sequences and generators, which can deepen your understanding of coroutines.

6. [The curious case of Pydantic and the 1970s timestamps](https://dev.arie.bovenberg.net/blog/pydantic-timestamps/)

Pydantic tries to guess whether Unix timestamps are in seconds or milliseconds, but this causes problems with timestamps from before 1970! As we know, timestamps in the computer world start from 1970-1-1 (the Unix epoch), which means that early timestamps have fewer digits, and if we interpret them as seconds, we'll be off by decades!

7. [In-browser code playgrounds](https://antonz.org/in-browser-code-playgrounds/)

How to execute code snippets in real time on a browser? The author open-sourced a tool based on WASI that allows you to execute Python, PHP, Ruby, Lua, Javascript, and SQLite code snippets on a browser.

8. [Django, SQLite, and the Database is Locked Error](https://blog.pecar.me/django-sqlite-dblock)

In a multi-threaded environment, using SQLite may cause the "database is locked" error. The article analyzes two main reasons (SQLite waiting for the lock to time out, writing after reading in a transaction), introduces the corresponding solutions, and specifically mentions the solution provided by Django itself.

9. [Polars Tutorial](https://www.cnblogs.com/traditional/p/17959796)

Polars is a high-performance Python data processing library built on Rust + Arrow. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to Polars. (See also: [Polars Tutorial](https://pbpython.com/polars-intro.html))

10. [Building HTML components from Python functions](https://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/python-build-html-components-lxml/)

How to implement React-like components in Python? The author attempts to generate HTML with pure Python functions and render it using the `lxml` library. The article presents some basic experiments to demonstrate the feasibility.

11. [Happy New Year: GPT in 500 lines of SQL](https://explainextended.com/2023/12/31/happy-new-year-15/)

Can we implement a large language model in SQL? ChatGPT says it's beyond SQL's capability. However, the author disagrees! The article details the necessary knowledge to build GPT and eventually implements it in 500 lines of SQL! (See also: the author's annual tradition of doing something incredible with SQL since 2010, such as [solving a Rubik's Cube with SQL](https://explainextended.com/2022/12/31/happy-new-year-14/), [implementing a quantum computer simulator in SQL](https://explainextended.com/2021/12/31/happy-new-year-13/), ...)
