## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Optimizing Python Code Speed on a Single Core](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/optimizing-dithering/)

The article uses the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm as an example to demonstrate various techniques to improve code performance, reducing the execution time from 2339 microseconds down to 554 microseconds. Some of the concepts covered include instruction-level parallelism (ILP), branch prediction, single instruction multiple data (SIMD), and memory hierarchy.

2. [Learning About Code Metrics in Python with Radon](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/09/20/learning-about-code-metrics-in-python-with-radon/)

A basic introductory tutorial on how to use Radon to measure the complexity of Python code, i.e., calculate metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, and introduces the use of related commands.

3. [Python (mostly) is syntactic sugar](https://lwn.net/Articles/942767/)

Brett Cannon wrote a series of blog posts about "syntactic sugar", which analyzed more than 80 syntactic sugar features. The article introduces some of them based on his PyCon talk and blog posts.

4. [Welcome to the New SymPy](https://oscarbenjamin.github.io/blog/czi/post1.html)

SymPy is a library for symbolic computation, which can handle problems in areas such as algebra, calculus, and discrete mathematics. This is a series of posts about major changes coming to it. The post describes the current speed problems with SymPy, the work being done to speed it up, and plans for future speed improvements. (See also: [Part 2 of the series: Polynomial Evaluation in SymPy](https://oscarbenjamin.github.io/blog/czi/post2.html))

5. [Use import-linter to Make Your Python Project Architecture Cleaner](https://www.piglei.com/articles/use-import-linter-to-lint-proj-arch/)

In terms of dependency governance, [import-linter](https://github.com/seddonym/import-linter) is a very useful tool. It allows us to express the implicit complex dependencies within a project explicitly through a configuration file by providing various types of "contracts". This article introduces its basic usage and six tips for fixing dependencies.

6. [How CPython Uses Bloom Filters for String Manipulation](https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/cpython-bloom-filter-usage)

CPython uses Bloom filters for string manipulation, such as in the `splitlines()` and `strip()` functions. The article explains how these functions are implemented. It also discusses how a typical Bloom filter works and how CPython implements Bloom filters (in less than 50 lines of C code).

7. [UUIDs in Python](https://medium.com/@m____b____/uuids-with-python-b133cead1b4c)

This article introduces several methods of the `uuid` library: `uuid1()` generates a UUID using the system MAC address and a timestamp; `uuid4()` generates a completely random UUID; `uuid3()` and `uuid5()` generate UUIDs based on a constant namespace and a variable name, with the former using the MD5 algorithm and the latter using the SHA-1 algorithm.

8. [Why Are There So Many Python Dataframes?](https://ponder.io/why-are-there-so-many-python-dataframes/)

Why are there so many dataframe libraries, such as Pandas, Polars, Dask, and PySpark? The author argues that the main reason is its four role models: spreadsheet, relational database, 2D array/matrix, and object, and a series of problems derived from them.

9. [Simulating the Monty Hall Problem in Python](https://www.dataschool.io/python-probability-simulation/)

The Monty Hall problem, also known as the three-door problem, is a probability puzzle that challenges intuitive reasoning. The article uses Python to simulate the problem to see how many times it takes to win a prize.

10. [6 Cool Things You Can Do with the Functools Module](https://pybit.es/articles/6-cool-things-you-can-do-with-the-functools-module/)

The article introduces six use cases for the functools standard library: @cache for caching, @total_ordering to save you from writing the rich comparison methods, partial() for freezing arguments, @singledispatch for generic functions, @wraps for decorators, and reduce() function.

11. [A Deep Dive into pytest.main(): Unraveling the Core Functionality of the Python Testing Framework](https://juejin.cn/post/7281491804736831542)

`pytest.main` is a handy function in the Pytest framework for running test suites from the command line or programmatically. The article explores its usage and some common use cases.

12. [7 Best Python Authentication Libraries You Should Use in Your Next Project](https://python.plainenglish.io/7-best-python-authentication-libraries-you-should-use-in-your-next-project-c07b668d5348)

Introduces seven great authentication libraries: **Authlib, Pyjwt, Flask-login, Django-allauth, ItsDangerous, Python Social Auth, Flask-security**. (Also available in [Chinese translation](https://juejin.cn/post/7281150086351732751).)
