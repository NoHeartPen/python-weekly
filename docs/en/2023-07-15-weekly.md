## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Run Python Code with Golang and Docker](https://soulteary.com/2023/05/21/run-python-code-with-golang-and-docker.html)

How can we use Golang to run Python code? What are the usage limitations regarding Python versions and hardware? This article uses Docker to solve the problem of environmental dependencies and successfully runs Python code with Golang using the open-source project **cpy3**. It has a sequel, [Implement Python Computing Services with Golang and Docker](https://soulteary.com/2023/05/22/using-golang-and-docker-to-implement-python-computing-services.html), which encapsulates ordinary Python software packages as high-performance services that can be called via **gRPC**.

2. [The Answer Is in the Code: The Double Meaning of ‚ÄúFulfill Requirements‚Äù](https://www.piglei.com/articles/the-answer-is-in-the-code-fulfill-requirements/)

Many programmers tend to overlook one thing: the time spent reading code is much longer than the time spent writing it! This means that **code readability** is very important, so when we ‚Äúfulfill requirements‚Äù, in addition to considering the user's functional requirements, we should also pay more attention to how to write readable code.

3. [Relieving Your Python Packaging Pain](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/relieving-your-python-packaging-pain) (EN)

@NoHeartPen Contribution: After reading the [ÂêêÊßΩ](https://www.v2ex.com/t/938669#reply88) about conda in the first issue, I started to pay attention to this problem, but I haven't found a relatively systematic summary. After reading this article, I finally had a general idea (this article not only wrote "how to do it", but also wrote "why", which made me change my bad habit of not building a virtual environment and give up tossing conda). In addition, I attach the translated version [How to Relieve the Pain of Python Packaging](https://blog.csdn.net/csdnnews/article/details/131546123).

4. [CuPy: Dispatch NumPy Arrays to Run on GPU](https://www.cnblogs.com/traditional/p/17536459.html)

[CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) is a NumPy-compatible library with GPU support (7K stars). This article introduces its installation and the basics of arrays.

5. [Python Source Code Analysis: Deep Dive into CPython Objects](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000044006618)

8. [When Plans Go Astray: My Unsuccessful Journey of Migrating a Large Django Project to Mypy](https://dev.to/derlin/when-plans-go-astray-my-unsuccessful-journey-of-migrating-a-large-django-project-to-mypy-3l23) (English)

The author encountered many issues when adding Mypy type checking to a production project: many libraries don't provide pyi types, TypedDict has limited use, Optional types require many assertions, mixin classes need to implement protocols, and Django models don't support generics. In short, adding type checking to a legacy project is painful and is best considered from the beginning.
