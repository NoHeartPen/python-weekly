# Python Trending Weekly #12

Welcome to the 12th issue of Python Trending Weekly, a weekly newsletter about Python, AI and general programming techniques. The [original version](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-07-22-weekly) of the weekly publication was written in Chinese, and what you are reading here is the English version translated by ChatGPT.

Most of the content shared here is in English, with a small portion in Chinese, which is indicated in the title. It took a lot of courage for me to publish this weekly publication, originally intended for Chinese readers, to the English-speaking world. Your feedback is welcome, and I appreciate your [subscription](https://pythoncat.substack.com/s/python-trending-weekly) and support!
