# Python Trending Weekly #35 (2024-01-13)

Welcome to the Python Trending Weekly, a weekly newsletter about Python, AI and general programming techniques, with the majority links in English and a small portion in Chinese. 

The [original version](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2024-01-13-weekly) of the weekly  was written in Chinese. What you are reading here is mostly translated by LLMs.

## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Python 3.13 gets a JIT](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/python-gets-a-jit.html)

What is JIT (Just in Time)? How does it work? What are the benefits of Python + JIT? Copy-and-patch JIT is a design proposed in 2021, which is a high-speed algorithm specially designed for dynamic language runtime. Python 3.13 is expected to implement it! The first sharing of the last issue of the weekly was about it, and we will continue in this issue~

2. [NumPy 2 is coming: preventing breakage, updating your code](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/numpy-2/)

NumPy 2 is a major release scheduled for March/April 2024. It is a backwards incompatible release, so it is important to prepare in advance to ensure that our applications do not break. This article discusses the incompatible changes in the new version, how to make sure that you install the new version at the right time, and how to upgrade your code painlessly.

3. [The counter-intuitive rise of Python in scientific computing](https://cerfacs.fr/coop/fortran-vs-python)

The article raises a question: in the field of scientific computing that focuses on performance, Fortran used to be very popular, why is Python, which is slower, increasingly used now? The reason may be that people overestimate the importance of execution speed, and the agility and maintainability of programming are more important, and the performance of alternative solutions is not bad. (See also: [Fortran community discussion](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/the-counter-intuitive-rise-of-python-in-scientific-computing/469).)

4. [Fast and Efficient Inequality Joins in Pandas](https://samukweku.github.io/data-wrangling-blog/notebooks/Fast-and-Efficient-Inequality-Joins-in-Pandas.html#summary)

Pandas supports equi-joins using the **merge** and **join** functions, but what about inequality joins? This article presents two alternatives to the usual Cartesian product: using the `pyjanitor` library's `conditional_join` function, which is both memory-efficient and performant; and using DuckDB's SQL to query a DataFrame, which is extremely performant.

5. [Pandas Profiling: A Detailed Explanation](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/pandas-profiling-tutorial/)

`Pandas profiling` is a popular library (renamed to `ydata-profiling`) that generates a profiling report of a dataset in just one line of code. This tutorial covers how it works, how to import and generate a report, how to analyze and handle sensitive data, how to profile big data, its alternatives, and its drawbacks.

6. [A Deep Dive Into Python's functools.wraps Decorator](https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/Functools-Deep-Dive)

Python decorators are one of my favorite features. When we define our own decorators, we need to consider the loss of metadata, and `functools.wraps` is the key. The article introduces its usage, how to use it, and how to pass custom arguments.

7. [SIMD in Pure Python](https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/python-swar.html)

The author shares how to implement **Game of Life** in pure Python (with `pysdl2` for graphics), running at 4K resolution at 180fps, which is ~3800x faster than the naive implementation.

8. [Best practices to protect your Flask applications](https://escape.tech/blog/best-practices-protect-flask-applications/)

What are the best practices to secure your Flask project and protect it from security vulnerabilities? Based on the **OWASP Top 10** most common vulnerabilities, this article introduces methods for loading JSON with `yaml.safe_load`, parsing XML with `defusedxml`, securing forms with `flask_wtf`, handling file paths with `secure_filename`, preventing XSS and CSRF, and nine recommendations for building secure APIs, among other things. It covers libraries such as **Flask-SSLify, Flask-RESTful, Flask-HTTPAuth, Flask-JWT-Extended, and Flask-Limiter**.

9. [Pushing real-time updates to clients with Server-Sent Events (SSEs)](https://rednafi.com/python/server_sent_events/)

Server-Sent Events (SSEs) is a way for a web server to send real-time information to a web page without the page having to repeatedly poll the server. This article provides a complete example of how to implement it in Python, and also points out its two limitations at the end.

10. [Building AI-powered TODO app](https://tolkunov.dev/posts/ai-powered-todo-app/)

What would a TODO app look like in the era of AI? The author implemented a TODO project with Django + simple HTML + Whisper + mixtral-8x7b-instruct + SQLite, which is worth learning and referencing!

11. [ PEP 736 ‚Äì Shorthand syntax for keyword arguments at invocation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0736/)

This PEP proposes to introduce a syntactic sugar `f(x=)` as a shorthand for `f(x=x)` when the name of the keyword argument and the value are the same. It is similar to `f'{x=}'` in f-string, and similar shorthands can be found in Ruby, JavaScript, and Rust. Statistically, this pattern accounts for 10-20% of keyword argument usage.

12. [How To Remove Background From Image In Python](https://pythonguides.com/remove-background-from-image-in-python/)

This tutorial introduces how to remove the background of an image using `Tkinter` and `rembg`, and the effect is quite good.
