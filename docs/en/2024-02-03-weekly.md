4. [Ten Python datetime pitfalls, and what libraries are (not) doing about it](https://dev.arie.bovenberg.net/blog/python-datetime-pitfalls/)

The author analyzes 10 pitfalls of the `datetime` module and introduces the situation of mainstream third-party libraries (such as `arrow`, `pendulum`, `DateType`, `heliclockter`), and finds that most of them have the same problems. What is a better date and time library? The author open-sourced a library that attempts to solve the problems in the article.

5. [4 Ways to Correct Grammar with Python](https://www.listendata.com/2024/01/4-ways-to-correct-grammar-with-python.html)

8. [Analyzing "Sorting a million 32-bit integers in 2MB of RAM using Python"](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/analyzing-sorting-a-million-32-bit)

This article is an analysis and interpretation of Guido's 2008 article [Sorting a million 32-bit integers in 2MB of RAM using Python](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/sorting-million-32-bit-integers-in-2mb.html). The solution uses the less common modules `struct`, `array`, and `heapq`, as well as techniques such as context managers and generators.

9. [Implement Parsers with Pylasu](https://tomassetti.me/implement-parsers-with-pylasu/)

This tutorial shows how to define an AST with Pylasu, generate a parser using ANTLR, implement a transformation from the ANTLR parse tree to the Pylasu AST, and finally build a toy programming language parser with a CLI.

10. [Dynamic Programming is not Black Magic](https://qsantos.fr/2024/01/04/dynamic-programming-is-not-black-magic/)

What is dynamic programming? What are its features and advantages compared to other approaches? This article starts with a common programming problem and gradually introduces caching, optimizing the cache, and dynamic programming, unveiling the mystery of dynamic programming.

11. [Reasons to avoid static type checking](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/typing_anti_pitch.html)

Python supports type hints, but it's not mandatory. In fact, there are many cases where it's not recommended to use type hints. This document from the typing module lists some reasons why you might want to avoid using type hints.

12. [Running Open Source LLMs In Python - A Practical Guide](https://christophergs.com/blog/running-open-source-llms-in-python)

How to run large language models on your personal laptop? This tutorial provides a complete walkthrough of running llama.cpp on different operating systems, including selecting and downloading the model, setting prompts, formatting LLM outputs using GBNF grammars, streaming responses, multimodal models, and more.
