## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Error Handling Patterns in Programming Languages](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-05-08-error)

This article discusses four common ways of handling errors in programming: returning error codes (C, Go), exceptions (Java, C#, Python, C++), callback functions (JavaScript), and result objects (Haskell, Rust, Kotlin). Each approach is analyzed, with their advantages and disadvantages, and things to keep in mind when using them.

2. [A Deep Dive into the Python Virtual Machine: The Implementation Principle of Descriptors and Source Code Analysis](https://github.com/Chang-LeHung/dive-into-cpython/blob/master/obsy/03decriptor.md)

This article introduces the implementation principle of descriptors, analyzes the bytecode instructions related to descriptors in the CPython source code, and uses Python code to explain the execution logic of descriptors. The article is from the "A Deep Dive into the Python Virtual Machine" series on Github, which already contains 20+ articles.

3. [AI Sun Yanzi Model Application Practice](https://v3u.cn/a_id_310)

Recently, AI Sun Yanzi has become very popular! Based on Python3.10 and open-source libraries such as so-vits-svc (an expressive voice synthesis model), Spleeter (separation of vocals and accompaniment), and FFMPEG (merging of voice and accompaniment), this article demonstrates step-by-step how to make AI Sun Yanzi sing songs. (P.S. Due to concerns about copyright infringement risks, the so-vits-svc project has been archived.)

4. [Write a Python Package in C](https://juejin.cn/post/7229485914219642941)

The article introduces the C language API related features of Python and finally implements a C extension module that imitates the official `datetime`. The article comes from the first article of the `Python C Language API Series Tutorial`, which has been updated with two articles so far.

5. [Python Toolbox Series of Articles](https://www.cnblogs.com/shanxihualu/p/17391082.html)

This is a series of articles, which currently contains 31 articles. The latest introduced tools are related to databases: Neo4j (a NoSQL graph database, operated with Py2neo), PostgreSQL (a relational database, operated with Psycopg2), MongoDB, Access, ClickHouse, Redis, etc.

6. [PEP-713: Callable Modules](https://peps.python.org/pep-0713) (English)

A new proposal by ≈Åukasz Langa to allow defining a \_\_call\_\_ object in a module's global namespace to make the module directly callable, where the \_\_call\_\_ object can be a standard function or any callable object. The proposal is currently in draft status and has not been accepted.

7. [‚ÄúExternally managed environments‚Äù: When PEP-668 Affects pip](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/externally-managed-environment-pep-668)

You may encounter the ‚Äúexternally managed environment‚Äù error when using pip install on a newer Linux system. The reason: Linux distributions pre-install certain Python packages, and pip install may cause conflicts with system packages. Solutions: Use virtual environments for development; Don‚Äôt use system Python in Docker; Use pipx if you need the latest tools. Python package management is painful and unlikely to improve anytime soon.

8. [Bevy v2.0: A Dependency Injection Framework for Python](https://blog.zech.codes/bevy-v2) (English)

Bevy v2.0 is a powerful dependency injection framework that helps simplify the management of Python applications. The article introduces three methods to resolve dependencies: global variables, parameter passing, and dependency injection. Bevy v2.0 employs techniques including parameter injection, property injection, repositories, and dependency constructor.
