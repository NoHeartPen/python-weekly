## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [How to Profile the Performance of Asynchronous Requests in FastAPI](https://blog.balthazar-rouberol.com/how-to-profile-a-fastapi-asynchronous-request)

**cProfile**, a function call-based profiling tool, is not effective in profiling the execution time of asynchronous operations. This article introduces [pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument), a profiling library, combined with the **FastAPI.middleware** decorator, and uses [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope) to visualize the time consumption of FastAPI programs.

2. [Leveraging Background Tasks in FastAPI: Enhancing Performance and Responsiveness](https://noplacelikelocalhost.medium.com/leveraging-background-tasks-in-fastapi-enhancing-performance-and-responsiveness-6e4ad64c7d16)

Introduces FastAPI's BackgroundTasks, which allow you to create background tasks to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main process.

3. [Creating Histograms with Python](https://compucademy.net/creating-histograms-with-python/)

A histogram, also known as a bar chart, is a graphical representation that organizes and displays the distribution of data. It provides insights into the data's central tendency, spread, and outliers. This article explores how to create histograms using various Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, Numpy, and Pandas. It covers different histogram styles and customizations, handling outliers, and analyzing time-series data.

4. [Mypy 1.5 Released](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2023/08/mypy-15-released.html)

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. The major features of version 1.5 include: dropping support for Python 3.7, more flexible TypedDict creation and updates, documentation links that show error codes, experimental improvements to type inference in generic functions, partial support for Python 3.12, and more.

5. [What happens when you run a Python "Hello World" script on Linux?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/03/behind--hello-world/)

You write `print("hello world")` in a `.py` file, and then execute it from the command line. What happens behind the scenes? The article uses tools like `readelf`, `strace`, `ldd`, `debugfs`, `/proc`, `ltrace`, `dd`, and `stat` to explain in detail the process of executing the script. It mainly involves operating system related content, rather than the CPython interpreter. (P.S. The article also references the recently popular [Putting the "You" in CPU](https://cpu.land/), which introduces how computers run programs. Highly recommended!)

6. [Learn PostScript by Contrasting It with Python](https://kenschutte.com/postscript-vs-python)

PostScript is a page description language in the electronic publishing and desktop publishing domains, widely used in printers, publishing, and graphics devices. The article translates a piece of PostScript code directly into Python code, which can help you quickly understand the syntax of this language.

7. [Casual Performance Optimization in Python](https://www.nathom.dev/blog/casual_performance_optimization_python/)

The author's code took 950 milliseconds in Rust, but 70 seconds in Python! How could this be tolerated! After changing the generator to a for loop, there was only a slight speedup. After some optimizations using Numpy and multiprocessing, we finally saw some significant improvements. A comparison of different code solutions, Python's underlying working principles, memory usage efficiency issues, and differences in language features.

8. [Creating a Context Manager in Python](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/creating-a-context-manager/)

How do you create your own context manager in Python? A context manager is an object that can be used in a `with` block to perform some actions on entry and exit. This article explores the details of implementing a context manager.

9. [A simple module to swap ints in the Python interpreter](https://kenschutte.com/python-swap-ints)

An interesting article. After importing a module, 8 and 9 can be swapped, i.e. `print(8)` will print 9. The article shows how to write a simple module in C, introduces the implementation of the integer object pool in CPython, and achieves a simple number tampering effect by modifying the references of two integers.

10. [Why Python is terrible‚Ä¶](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/why-python-is-terrible)

An article that throws cold water on Python, the main point of view is that Python is not suitable for developing large applications. The criticisms include dynamic and duck typing, performance issues, code maintenance and refactoring difficulties.

11. [Best practices for error handling in Python](https://pybit.es/articles/python-errors-should-not-pass-silently/)

The Zen of Python says "Errors should never pass silently", emphasizing that errors should be faced head-on and handled transparently. The article points out some bad error handling practices and provides programming suggestions such as checking errors early and handling failures quickly.

12. [Build GPT-powered chatbots around enterprise data with Python](https://www.pythongasm.com/build-gpt-powered-chatbots-around-enterprise-data-with-python)

This tutorial introduces the complete process of building a GPT chatbot in an enterprise, including data indexing, query retrieval, LLM integration, API development using FastAPI, and deployment with uvicorn.

13. [Python cocktail: Mix context managers and iterators in equal measure](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/python-cocktail-mix-a-context-manager)

The **tenacity** library provides a way to implement retry mechanisms using a combination of iterators and context managers. This article demonstrates how to achieve the same functionality with custom iterators and context managers, allowing you to gain a deeper understanding of these two useful features.

14. [The power of indexing: Boosting data wrangling efficiency with Pandas](https://stackabuse.com/the-power-of-indexing-boosting-data-wrangling-efficiency-with-pandas/)

Pandas is widely used for data processing, and this article introduces how to efficiently utilize indexing techniques to improve its data wrangling speed and efficiency. It introduces various indexing techniques, such as integer-based indexing, Boolean indexing, setting new indices and resetting old ones, and sorting indices.

15. [Killing the ProcessPoolExecutor](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/killing-the-processpoolexecutor)

Python is not suitable for handling CPU-intensive tasks. The project in the article originally used a process pool to circumvent the GIL issue, and later used threads, C++ extensions, and more refined GIL control to reduce memory usage by 50%, CPU usage by about 20%, threads and processes by about 70%, and I/O traffic by 100%.
