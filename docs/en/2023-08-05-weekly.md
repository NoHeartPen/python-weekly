üéÅ Python Trending Weekly üéÅ organizes its content into seasons, with every 30 issues forming a season. The highlights from the first season have been compiled for your convenience. You can access them online [here](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-12-11-weekly) (Chinese).

## üêøÔ∏èProjects & Resources

1. [PyFlo: A Fascinating Python Learning Website](https://pyflo.net/) 

This website is amazing, and I highly recommend checking it out! The homepage features a learning roadmap that illustrates various learning paths and content categories. It also includes several programming project challenges. Clicking on each node takes you to the corresponding content page. (It would be interesting to develop a similar website for Chinese readers.)

![Part of the roadmap](https://img.pythoncat.top/2023-08-05_pyflo.png)

2. [Pandas Tutor: A Website to Visualize Pandas Execution](https://pandastutor.com/)

You may already know [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/), an educational tool that provides an online interactive Python programming environment. The Pandas Tutor introduced here is a similar website that allows you to write Pandas code in a browser and visualize how the data is being transformed. (An article by two authors introduces their work of [porting Pandas Tutor to Pyodide](https://blog.pyodide.org/posts/pandastutor/) to facilitate teaching data science at scale.)

This is a sister project of **pystack**, which was introduced in [issue #12](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-07-22-weekly) of the weekly. It can track memory allocations in Python code, C/C++ extension modules, and the Python interpreter itself. It supports native mode and live-view mode, and can generate multiple types of reports. It provides a Pytest plugin [pytest-memray](https://github.com/bloomberg/pytest-memray) that allows you to view memory reports after running a test suite. (11k stars)

5. [textual-paint: MS Paint in your terminal](https://github.com/1j01/textual-paint)

**MS Paint** is a simple image editing software developed by Microsoft. This project is a TUI image editor in the style of MS Paint, supporting opening and saving images in the terminal, all the tools in MS Paint, a color palette, brush preview, and more.

6. [rich: Rich Text and Beautiful Styling for Terminals](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)

7. [json-lineage: A tool for parsing large JSON files](https://github.com/Salaah01/json-lineage)

This is a JSON parsing library developed in Rust that addresses the pain point of large files not being able to be loaded into memory. It solves the memory consumption problem by converting JSON to JSONL format. Tests show that when processing a 500MB file, the Python standard library uses 2GB of memory, while this library only needs 1.5MB, and the speed difference is very small.

8. [PythonMonkey: A JavaScript Engine Embedded in the Python VM](https://github.com/Distributive-Network/PythonMonkey)

PythonMonkey, which has been mentioned before, embeds Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine into the Python virtual machine, using the Python engine to provide a JS host environment. The goals of this project include calling JavaScript libraries in Python and calling Python libraries in JavaScript. If the ecosystems of these two languages can be effectively connected, the future is immeasurable!

9. [cuDF: GPU Data Frame Library](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)

cuDF is a GPU DataFrame library for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise manipulating data, built on the **Apache Arrow** columnar in-memory format. It provides a pandas-like API, without the need to know the details of CUDA programming. (5.8K stars)
