# Python Trending Weekly #31 (2023-12-16)

Welcome to the Python Trending Weekly, a weekly newsletter about Python, AI and general programming techniques, with the majority links in English and a small portion in Chinese. 

The [original version](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-12-16-weekly) of the weekly was written in Chinese. What you are reading here is mostly translated by LLMs.

## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [PEP-738: Adding Android as a Tier 3 Supported Platform](https://pep-previews--3586.org.readthedocs.build/pep-0738/#)

In issue 24 of the Weekly, we shared [PEP-730: CPython providing official support for iOS](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/). This PEP-738 turns the target to the Android system. Both PEPs are currently in draft status, but Android uses the Linux kernel, so maybe this PEP has a greater chance of being adopted? (Appendix: [Python on Mobile: State of the Union](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-summit-2023-python.html) at the Python Language Summit this year)

2. [Marker: A Deep Dive into the Source Code of the AI-Powered PDF Layout Detection Engine](https://journal.hexmos.com/marker-pdf-document-ai/)

In just two weeks, the PDF-to-Markdown tool **Marker**, which was featured in issue 29, has nearly reached 5K stars. This article explains how it works, describing its six stages and the tools it relies on (PyMuPDF, OCRMyPDF, Tesseract, etc.).

3. [Real-world match/case](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202312/realworld_matchcase.html)

Python 3.10 introduced the **match-case** pattern matching syntax. Have you used it in your projects? This article presents a use case: processing complex JSON data returned by a GitHub bot. It shows how match-case simplifies the code compared to traditional approaches.

4. [Pytest Daemon: 10x Local Test Iteration Speed](https://discord.com/blog/pytest-daemon-10x-local-test-iteration-speed)

Discord's official blog post shares their story of improving a test from 20 seconds to 2 seconds! The trick is to use "**pytest daemon**" and hot reloading, which ensures that a process is ready when you need to run tests, eliminating the overhead of preparing it on the fly. The post also mentions an open-source project [pytest-hot-reloading](https://github.com/JamesHutchison/pytest-hot-reloading/) that achieves the same goal.

5. [Android AI App in 88 Lines of Python Code](https://vra.github.io/2023/10/14/android-ai-app-in-88-lines-of-python-code/)

It sounds like a difficult task to develop a demo of SDXL text-to-image on a mobile phone, but this article claims it can be done with only 88 lines of Python code! The technologies used are Beeware and LeptonAI. We have mentioned Beeware many times in our weekly (for example, the two PEPs mentioned above are closely related to it), and LeptonAI is an entrepreneurial project of the well-known AI expert @jiayangqing.

6. [You Don't Need This in Python](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/you-dont-need-this-in-python)

The author points out some common Python redundancies/mistakes, including `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` , `range(len(xx))` , keeping track of loop positions, using index() to check for containment, and separate getters and setters. The first one about encoding is indeed very common, and it also reminds me of another one that is often used unconsciously: `if __name__ == '__main__'` . (See also: [Why I Don't Recommend Writing a So-Called main Function?](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2020-06-03-main))

7. [Why ‚Äúif TYPE_CHECKING‚Äù?](https://vickiboykis.com/2023/12/11/why-if-type_checking/)

The purpose of `if TYPE_CHECKING` is to enable conditional importing of modules. A basic example is shown below:

```Python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from collections.abc import Sequence

def func(value: Sequence[int]) -> None:
    pass
```

When would you want to do this? The article explains the need for this pattern, and the short answer is: to balance the trade-off between type checking enforced by mypy and type checking at runtime, especially in the presence of many circular dependencies.

8. [Comparison of SQLALchemy and Django ORM](https://st4lk.github.io/en/blog/2023/12/09/sqlalchemy-vs-django-orm/)

Both are object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks for relational databases. The author introduces some differences and correct usage of the two from the perspective of switching from Django ORM to SQLAlchemy, avoiding making mistakes when using them.

9. [Python \_\_init\_\_.py Best Practices](https://coderslegacy.com/python-init-py-best-practices/)

`__init__.py` is a special file in Python. Why do we need such a file? What is its role? How to customize this file? What are some usage tips and best practices? This article provides a detailed tutorial.

10. [Mojo: The Point of View of a Researcher Using Python](https://augierpi.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/mojo-the-point-of-view-of-a-researcher-using-python.html)

A systematic analysis of Mojo. The author's research questions are: What is Mojo? What will be its future? Is Mojo useful for general scientific computing (not only AI)? When will it be really usable? What is still missing? The author does not agree with the popular saying "**Mojo==Python++**", but rather studies it as a novel static language.

11. [Simple HTTP Status Codes in Python](https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2023/dec/04/python-http-status-codes/)

Don't use numeric literals for HTTP request status codes in your code. This is considered a "magic number" and is bad practice. Frameworks like Django, Starlette, and Litestar provide enums, but the recommended way is to use the `http.HTTPStatus` from the standard library. Additionally, starting with Python 3.12, you can use `HTTPStatus.is_success` to check for 2xx status codes. (Note: This article is part of the author's daily "Advent of Code" series, which contains various programming tips. [Read more on the blog](https://www.b-list.org/weblog/))

12. [CPython Development Practice: Implementing the None-aware Operators ?. and ??](https://juejin.cn/post/7310101543776829440)

[PEP-505 None-aware operators](https://peps.python.org/pep-0505/) is a deferred proposal to simplify conditional handling when checking for `None`. The article introduces the three None-aware operators in the PEP and provides a simple implementation. It also mentions two dissenting comments on the proposal, and I would like to add my own: let's not add it, keep it Deferred!

13. [Code is Run More than Read](https://olano.dev/2023-11-30-code-is-run-more-than-read/)

"**Code is read more than written**" is a fundamental principle in programming, reminding developers to focus on code readability and maintainability. The author refines it to "maintainer > author". However, coding is just a means to an end, which is to provide service to users, so it's "user > dev". And the ultimate goal is to create business value, so the initial conclusion is "biz > user > ops > dev". Is this conclusion correct? The author considers/weighs the importance of each factor and lists several relationships. The final concise conclusion is: user > ops > dev, biz > ops > dev, biz ‚âà user.
