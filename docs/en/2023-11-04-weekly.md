## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Ruff: A Blazing Fast, Black-Compatible Python Formatter](https://astral.sh/blog/the-ruff-formatter)

I introduced Ruff, the fastest code analysis tool, in April this year, and found that it is not limited to the positioning of Linter, but also provides some Formatter functions. Now, it has released a major update and officially become the fastest Python code formatter, which is more than 30 times faster than **Black** and 100 times faster than **YAPF**!

2. [When Should You Upgrade to Python 3.12?](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/upgrade-python-3.12/)

Python 3.12 is out, and you are eager to upgrade. Is now the best time to make the jump to 3.12? The article suggests that you wait until December for the 3.12.1 bug-fix release because the new version has these issues: incompatible packages, missing binary packages, and every major release has a bunch of issues that need to be fixed.

3. [Python 3.12: An Epic Release That Went Under the Radar](https://www.manjusaka.blog/posts/2023/10/29/the-most-important-thing-in-python-3-12/)

The author believes that Python 3.12 is more significant to Python than 3.5's "async/await" and 3.6's "Type Hint"! The author mainly analyzes three aspects of improvement: observability brought by PEP-669, performance improvement brought by PEP-684 for non-GIL, and the new C API in PEP-697 that ensures compatibility across versions.

4. [Do Not Use requirements.txt Anymore](https://quanttype.net/posts/2023-10-31-do-not-use-requirements.txt.html)

The author provides two suggestions: do not use pip and `requirements.txt` to manage Python dependencies, and recommends using Poetry instead. The main problems with pip are the lack of a lockfile and the hassle of manually managing virtual environments. In addition to Poetry, the author also mentions Hatch and PDM.

5. [Why Is the Django Admin Interface So Ugly?](https://www.coderedcorp.com/blog/why-is-the-django-admin-ugly/)

Django provides a default admin interface, Django Admin, whose UI hasn't changed in many years and looks outdated. Why don't Django maintainers improve it? The author found out its history and the reasons for such design by interviewing several maintainers. The main point is that Django Admin is for internal administrators and shouldn't be exposed to end users.

6. [My User Experience Porting Off setup.py](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2023/10/30/my-user-experience-porting-off-setup.py/)

A long article by the author of PyOxidizer, who encountered an issue where `python setup.py` in CI failed with setuptools import errors when using Python 3.12 for another library. The author went through a complex and time-consuming process to find a solution, highlighting the confusing state of Python's packaging ecosystem.

7. [Boost Your Coding Efficiency with Ptpython](https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/)

Ptpython is a feature-rich and user-friendly Python REPL, and this is a very detailed tutorial on how to use it. The highlighted features include history, input validation, autocompletion, automatic indentation handling, customizing the interactive shell, embedding ptpython in scripts, and more.

8. [100% Test Coverage Is Not Enough: Property-Based Testing in Python](https://blog.robertroskam.com/p/100-test-coverage-is-not-enough)

While test coverage is important, it is not a silver bullet. This article demonstrates the shortcomings of test coverage with examples and briefly introduces how to do property-based testing with Hypothesis.

9. [Writing an ASGI Web Framework from Scratch in Python](https://www.cnblogs.com/hanabi-cnblogs/p/17792740.html)

Is it difficult to write an asynchronous ASGI web framework from scratch? What knowledge do you need to know, what functions do you need to implement, and what problems do you need to think about? This step-by-step tutorial is a great learning material, allowing you to understand web framework design, asynchronous programming, functional encapsulation, and project management.

10. [How to Hide Plaintext Passwords in Python Logs?](https://www.cnblogs.com/frankming/p/17762591.html)

It is a security requirement not to print plaintext passwords in logs, but there are too many possible scenarios where passwords may be printed. How can plaintext passwords be hidden efficiently? This article introduces two implementation schemes based on the **logging** module: a custom filter and a custom formatter, which use specific rules to filter plaintext passwords.

11. [From Chaos to Cohesion: Building Your Own Monorepo](https://monadical.com/posts/from-chaos-to-cohesion.html)

A monorepo is a code repository that stores all projects, possibly containing different languages and frameworks. This means that its dependency management and CI/CD are different from those of ordinary code repositories. This article introduces how to use GitHub Actions as a CI/CD tool to build a simple Python monorepo.

12. [Python Is a Compiled Language](https://eddieantonio.ca/blog/2023/10/25/python-is-a-compiled-language/)

We are used to calling Python an interpreted language because it interprets and executes code line by line at runtime. Many people also know that Python actually has a compilation process, and the interpreter compiles before executing. However, the author does not stop there. Through Socratic dialogue and several rounds of experiments, he leads readers to rethink "interpretation" and "compilation": they are false dichotomies that limit the possibilities of programming languages. Python is both an interpreted and a compiled language!

üéÅ Python Trending Weekly üéÅ organizes its content into seasons, with every 30 issues forming a season. The highlights from the first season have been compiled for your convenience. You can access them online [here](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-12-11-weekly) (Chinese).
