The author wants to provide a standardized dependency lockfile for Python. They initiated [PEP-665](https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/) in 2021, but it was rejected due to the lack of support for sdist . The author is now doing some proof-of-concept work, planned in 5 steps, and has reached step 3.

There are many version control and diff tools available, but can we build a simple one using Python? The article uses **difflib, argparse, and HtmlDiff** to build a file comparison tool in both a command-line and an HTML web page version.

16. [My Favorite Prime Number Generator](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/my-favorite-prime-number-generator/)

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for generating prime numbers. The author provides a Python implementation, but the code's performance and memory usage are major concerns. So the author made some optimizations and improvements, and finally gives an optimized version with detailed comments.

## ü•ÇDiscussion & Questions

1. [If you only know Python, how to build the front end of a web application?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/15z1amc/how_to_build_the_front_end_of_a_web_app_if_you/)

When developing alone and wanting to quickly implement a full-stack SaaS application that supports user authentication, subscriptions, payment, and other business functions, how should the front end be selected? This Reddit post may provide you with some ideas/methods.

2. Three Popular Discussions About Python Backend on V2EX

The three most popular posts under the Python node recently: [How to Improve Yourself as a Python Backend Developer?](https://www.v2ex.com/t/962899), [Why Are There So Few Python Web Backends in China?](https://www.v2ex.com/t/965956), and [How Does Python Backend Compare to Java or Go?](https://www.v2ex.com/t/966460) From an employment perspective, Python backend is indeed less popular in China, and this is not limited to backend development; other areas also seem to be "cooling down" (except for AI-related fields). One of the original ideas behind Python Trending Weekly was to "steal fire" from Europe and America and inject vitality into the Python community in China. Hopefully, there will be fewer pessimistic sentiments in the forum in the future, such as the desire to abandon xx and find a new path.
