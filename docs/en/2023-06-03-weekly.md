# Python Trending Weekly #5 (2023-06-03)

Welcome to the Python Trending Weekly, a weekly newsletter about Python, AI and general programming techniques, with the majority links in English and a small portion in Chinese. 

The [original version](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-06-03-weekly) of the weekly  was written in Chinese. What you are reading here is mostly translated by LLMs.

## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [How Much Memory Does It Take to Run a Million Concurrent Tasks?](https://pkolaczk.github.io/memory-consumption-of-async/) (English)

The article tests the memory consumption of popular programming languages (Rust, Go, Java, C#, Python, Node.js, and Elixir) by running 1, 10K, 100K, and 1 million tasks, respectively. The ranking of these languages changes significantly as the number of tasks increases, which surprised me.

2. [Use These Methods to Make Your Python Concurrent Tasks Perform Better](https://towardsdatascience.com/use-these-methods-to-make-your-python-concurrent-tasks-perform-better-b693b7a633e1) (English)

What are the best practices when using asyncio? This article introduces the asyncio.gather, asyncio.as_completed, and asyncio.wait APIs, as well as the new asyncio.TaskGroup feature introduced in Python 3.11. (Also an [incomplete translation](https://juejin.cn/post/7237424021768011834).)

3. The original recommended article was a patchwork and not original, and has been deleted.

4. [The Ultimate Guide to Python Multithreading](https://programmingeeksclub.com/ultimate-python-multithreading-guide) (English)

This is also a long article that introduces all aspects of Python multithreading. It is really an ultimate guide.

5. [How Programming Languages Implement Concurrency: Concurrency Models](https://www.bmpi.dev/dev/deep-in-program-language/how-to-implement-concurrency/concurrency-model/)

This is another long article that introduces common concurrency models and how different programming languages implement them. Its companion article is "[How Programming Languages Implement Concurrency: Operating System Scheduling](https://www.bmpi.dev/dev/deep-in-program-language/how-to-implement-concurrency/os-scheduling/)", both of which are richly illustrated and informative.

6. [9 Survival Rules for Tencent Programmers](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000043833549)

The author shares his years of experience in code design, architecture design, and work thinking, such as the DRY principle, the SOLID principle, highly available design, how to "be lazy" in every possible way, and so on. (The article mentions the principles of object-oriented programming. Here, I would like to recommend another Tencent programmer's [Python Craftsman](https://github.com/piglei/one-python-craftsman) series, chapters 12-14.)

7. [A First Look at Python 3.12! PEP 701 -- Formalizing f-string Syntax](https://juejin.cn/post/7238274120881422392)

F-strings are one of Python's most useful features, but they also have a number of limitations. The upcoming 3.12 release will formalize the syntax for f-strings, as detailed in [PEP-701](https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/). This article provides a visual demonstration of how this change will affect the lexical analysis (lexing) of code.

8. [Five things to love about the new UI in PyCharm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2023/05/five-things-to-love-about-the-new-ui/) (English)

Have you tried the new UI in PyCharm yet? This official tutorial introduces how to use the new UI and its highlights.

9. [PEP-594 Has Been Implemented: Python 3.13 Removes 20 Stdlib Modules](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-594-has-been-implemented-python-3-13-removes-20-stdlib-modules/27124) (English)

Python 3.12's official release is still months away, but 3.13 is already here, eagerly removing 20 standard library modules. Notably, the 2to3 project and the lib2to3 module will also be removed.

10. [Grasshopper: An Open-Source Python Library for Load Testing](https://innovation.alteryx.com/introducing-grasshopper-an-open-source-python-library-for-load-testing/)(English)

Locust is the most popular distributed load testing library for Python, and the article introduces [Grasshopper](https://github.com/alteryx/locust-grasshopper), a new open-source performance testing library based on Locust and Pytest that is more comprehensive.

11. [Python Decorators: Enhance Your Code with Wrapping Wizardry](https://hackthedeveloper.com/python-decorator/) (English)

Python decorators are powerful tools for enhancing the behavior and flexibility of your code. The article covers everything from the basics to advanced topics, making it a great learning resource.

12. Three Hands-On Project Tutorials:

- [How to Make a Telegram Bot with Python](https://swiftuser.hashnode.dev/how-to-telegram-bot-with-python) (English): Build a Telegram bot, with the tutorial using Tornado as the backend and deploying the project on Render.
- [Implement DNS in a Weekend with Python](https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/index.html) (English): The tutorial guides you through implementing a DNS resolver with a total codebase of only about 200 lines, but the author provides a wealth of learning resources and code explanations that you'll definitely learn a lot from. Plus, there are 7 practice problems at the end of the tutorial to further develop the functionality of the DNS resolver. (Julia Evans is a treasure, check out her [blog](https://jvns.ca/), [website](https://wizardzines.com/), [pandas-cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook), and more, highly recommended!!!)
- [Build Your Own Git with Python](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/) (English): I'm giving this project full marks! The tutorial website is uniquely and coolly designed, starting with a minimum viable product and gradually adding code, guiding you step-by-step through implementing various Git features. Each chapter uses Git's diff to show you exactly what code has been added or removed, which is very conscientious and I doubt you'll find a second one like it on the whole internet!
