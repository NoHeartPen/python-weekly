# Python Trending Weekly #29 (2023-12-02)

Welcome to the Python Trending Weekly, a weekly newsletter about Python, AI and general programming techniques, with the majority links in English and a small portion in Chinese. 

The [original version](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-12-02-weekly) of the weekly  was written in Chinese. What you are reading here is mostly translated by LLMs.

## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Rust std fs slower than Python! Really!?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/m-IBomxu88DlNcEyOgyOew)

A long article begins with a strange question: a program written in Rust is slower than Python!? In the process of locating the root cause, the author repeatedly obtained the result that the Rust solution was slower than Python, and even the C version code was slower than Python! Going deeper and deeper, using various positioning methods, it was finally discovered that it was a problem with the AMD CPU kernel!

2. [Which Python timestamp function is the fastest?](https://www.dataroc.ca/blog/most-performant-timestamp-functions-python)

What are the functions for getting timestamps in Python? How do they perform? The article took 7 functions for performance measurement and found that time.time() is the fastest. After the article was published, it caused some controversy, so the author wrote a second article, comparing Win10, WSL2, and Ubuntu20, and also added a comparison of Python 3.10 and 3.12. (Attached: [The second article on performance comparison](https://www.dataroc.ca/blog/most-performant-timestamp-functions-python-2))

3. [Python Is Easy, Go Is Simple, But Simple != Easy](https://preslav.me/2023/11/27/python-is-easy-golang-is-simple-simple-is-not-easy/)

Python is easy to learn and use because it leaves a lot of the complex work to the interpreter, which makes it suitable for prototyping and rapid application development. Go is also simple, but it has more rules than Python and is more performant. The author suggests playing to the strengths of both.

4. [Unlocking C-level performance in df.apply with Numba](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/unlocking-c-level-performance-in-df-apply)

In Pandas 2.2.0, DataFrame.apply can specify a new numba engine to achieve parallelized operations. The article introduces the working principle of this engine, the application scenarios it supports and what it cannot do, and provides data for multiple performance tests.

5. [A Random List of Flask Maintainer To-Dos](https://davidism.com/maintainer-notes/)

The author, one of the maintainers of Flask, listed a to-do list for Flask contributors to work on. Most of us don't have experience maintaining open-source projects, so we may not be able to imagine the huge amount of non-coding stuff that maintainers have to do. (BTW: Flask lost its position as the second most starred web framework this week, being surpassed by FastAPI.)

6. [Running Python Concurrency with Subinterpreters](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/sub-interpreter-web-workers.html)

Python 3.12 exposed an API for subinterpreters. What can you do with it? How does it compare to threads and processes, and what are the performance implications? What happens when you try to use it for web development? The author experimented with a development version of Python 3.13, and the results were a mixed bag of surprises and crashes. Here's hoping for a truly GIL-less Python next year!

7. [New Open Source vs. Old Open Source](https://dev.to/taipy/new-open-source-vs-old-open-source-33k7)

The article selects 10 well-known libraries in the Python community and provides their corresponding alternative libraries. The most uncontroversial one is probably Ruff replacing Pylint, and others include: Taipy/Streamlit, Polars/Pandas, Dask/PySpark, PyTorch/TensorFlow, etc.

8. [Using Polars in a Pandas World](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/polars-pandas-interopability/)

Polars is a faster, more memory-efficient, and easier-to-use data processing library that can serve as a drop-in replacement for Pandas. But how can you integrate it with third-party libraries that you rely on? This article shows you several approaches to achieve a seamless transition from Pandas to Polars.

9. [What are Python's soft keywords?](https://mathspp.com/blog/til/pythons-soft-keywords)

Soft keywords are keywords that can be reassigned. The author wanted to use regular expressions to find all soft keywords from Python's latest grammar file. It turned out that only the following two lines of code are needed to do the trick (the following is the result of Python 3.12, i.e. there are 4 soft keywords now):

```python
>>> import keyword
>>> keyword.softkwlist
['_', 'case', 'match', 'type']
```

10. [Building a Robot Dad with Python](https://blog.untrod.com/2023/11/robot-dad.html)

To deal with his kid's questions, the author built a "robot dad". He used Eleven Labs for voice cloning, Picovoice for wake word detection, and finally called the ChatGPT API to get answers.

11. [How (and How Not) to Design REST APIs](https://github.com/stickfigure/blog/wiki/How-to-(and-how-not-to)-design-REST-APIs)

The article lists more than ten best practice rules for REST APIs, explaining what the rules mean and how to implement them. In addition, the author made fun of several widely used APIs from companies as counterexamples of the rules.

12. [How to Debug Asyncio Programs?](https://superfastpython.com/debug-asyncio/)

The article introduces several ways to debug Asyncio code, including enabling its debug log, running the event loop in debug mode, customizing debug information, etc. (P.S. Its sister article How to Profile Asyncio Programs analyzes slow programs and hot functions.)
