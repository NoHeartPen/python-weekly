2. [How much memory does a Python Asyncio coroutine take?](http://so1n.me/2023/05/29/python_asyncio_lib_overhead/)

The article's test result is about 2Kb. In addition, the article also tested the following questions: How many bare coroutines can be created per second? How many coroutines can be processed per second? How much improvement can be achieved in creating and processing coroutine tasks after using `uvloop`?

3. [How to Execute Multiple Coroutines with asyncio.Runner](https://superfastpython.com/asyncio-runner/)

asyncio.Runner is a new feature in Python 3.11 that allows you to execute multiple coroutines in the same event loop. The article covers how to run multiple coroutines using asyncio.run(), how to run multiple coroutines using the wrapper method, and how to use the asyncio.Runner class to execute coroutines in the same event loop in an adaptive or even conditional manner.

4. [Concurrency without Locks](https://hakibenita.com/django-concurrency)

In concurrent programming, it is common to use locks, but it is important to avoid overusing them. This article explores how to achieve concurrency with minimal reliance on locks, using the example of generating short links. The main idea is to "ask for forgiveness" instead of "checking in advance" and to use features provided by the PostgreSQL database.

5. [Contributing to CPython Diary (3) How CPython Works](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/639119164)

This article introduces how CPython runs Python code. The main processes are: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, compilation to bytecode, and execution of bytecode.

6. [Python JIT Compilers - Just-In-Time Compilation](https://coderslegacy.com/python-jit-compilers/) (EN)

This article explores the concept of JIT compilation and its benefits, and provides an in-depth analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of popular Python JIT compilers (such as PyPy, Numba, and Cython). It also presents best practices and guidelines for using JIT compilers in Python.

7. [What are CPython, Pypy, MicroPython, Jython, etc.?](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/whats-the-deal-with-cpython-pypy)

When we say Python, we usually mean the official implementation CPython, but there are many other "Pythons", such as Pypy, Jython, MicroPython, Brython, RustPython, etc. There are also many things that look like new "Pythons", such as Nuitka, WinPython, Psycho, Pyjion, etc. This article explains the concepts and tools involved.

8. [Python APScheduler: Experience the Power of AsyncIOScheduler](https://coderslegacy.com/python-apscheduler-asyncioscheduler/) (Eng)

APScheduler is a scheduling and automation task tool. Its AsyncIOScheduler supports scheduling asynchronous functions and coroutines. The article introduces its functions, advantages, and how to optimize asynchronous task scheduling requirements.

9. [Avoiding Technical Debt When Generating Code](https://sourcery.ai/blog/chatgpt-maintainable-code/)

GPT and other large language models can generate code quickly and in large quantities, but this can also lead to a lot of messy code. The article explores several ways to improve the code generated by these tools and integrate it into projects, including adopting an expert persona, providing examples, following best practices, adhering to standards and clear guidelines, and placing the code in the right place.

10. [When NumPy Is Slow](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/numpy-is-slow/)

How can you improve NumPy performance without considering parallelization? NumPy has three inherent bottlenecks: eager execution, generic compiled code, and high memory usage due to vectorization. To address these bottlenecks, the article presents four solutions: hand-optimizing the code, using JAX for just-in-time compilation, using Numba for just-in-time compilation, and using ahead-of-time compilation.

11. [Numba Tutorial: Accelerate Python Code with JIT Compilation](https://coderslegacy.com/python-numba-tutorial/)

Numba is a specialized just-in-time compiler that eliminates the overhead of interpretation by compiling Python code to efficient machine code, thereby improving performance. The article covers Numba's features, internals, key usage, and common gotchas.

12. [Automating Python Code Quality Improvements](https://blog.fidelramos.net/software/python-code-quality)

How can you improve code quality with less time and effort? The article introduces several tools for improving code quality (flake8, Black, isort, mypy, bandit, etc.) and ways to automate these tools using IDEs, CI, and pre-commit.

13. [Enhancing Data Analysis with PandasAI](https://cognibits.hashnode.dev/enhancing-data-analysis-with-pandasai)

PandasAI is a recently trending library that integrates AI conversational capabilities with Pandas, simplifying data manipulation. The article covers how to perform complex queries and visualize charts with PandasAI and introduces a dozen of its handy functions.

14. [Best Practices for Writing Unit Tests](https://www.codium.ai/blog/best-practices-for-writing-unit-tests/)

The benefits of unit testing are well-known, yet writing unit tests is one of the most disliked tasks for developers. The article lists 10 best practices for writing unit tests, explains the steps for writing unit tests manually, and finally introduces a method for automating test writing using Codium.AI.

15. [How Netflix Safely Migrated to GraphQL](https://netflixtechblog.com/migrating-netflix-to-graphql-safely-8e1e4d4f1e72)

A blog post from Netflix, introducing three testing strategies used during the safe migration of their mobile app from Falcor to GraphQL: A/B testing, Replay testing, and Sticky Canaries. A/B testing was used to assess the impact of the new feature on customers, Replay testing was used to verify the correctness of the migration, and Sticky Canaries were used to verify performance and business metrics.
