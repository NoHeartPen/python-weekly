## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [Xmas decorations, part 3](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/xmas-decorations-part-3)

This is the third article in the author's series on decorators, extracting three generic use cases from real-world usage in a variety of open source libraries: intercepting calls, acting as function registries, and enriching function behavior.

2. [This is not interview advice: a priority-expiry LRU cache without heaps or trees in Python](https://death.andgravity.com/lru-cache)

If this were a big company interview question, how would you implement the algorithm in the title without using heaps or binary search trees? The article teaches a lot by proposing a minimally viable solution, refining the code step by step, and comparing the time complexities of different approaches.

3. [Performance Analysis of Python's `dict()` and `{}`](https://madebyme.today/blog/python-dict-vs-curly-brackets/)

What are the differences between the two ways of creating a dictionary in Python: `dict()` and `{}`? This article provides an in-depth analysis by looking at their bytecode and the CPython interpreter source code. In terms of performance, the conclusion is that `{}` is faster than `dict()`. (Note: Python Why series has written about [Python Puzzle: Which is faster, `[]` or `list()`? Why? How much faster?](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2020-10-14-list))

4. [Augmenting the Markdown language for great Python Graphical Interfaces](https://www.taipy.io/posts/augmenting-the-markdown-language-for-great-python-graphical-interfaces)

The Taipy team has developed an enhanced Markdown API that generates graphical user interface elements in your content by adding tags.

5. [7 Python Memory Optimization Tricks To Enhance Your Code‚Äôs Efficiency](https://medium.com/techtofreedom/7-python-memory-optimization-tricks-to-enhance-your-codes-efficiency-5ef65bf415e7)

This article introduces seven techniques for optimizing memory in Python: using `__slots__` in class definitions, using generators, using `mmap` for handling large files, reducing the use of global variables, taking advantage of short-circuit evaluation of logical operators, choosing appropriate data types, and using string interning.

6. [Garbage collection in Python: things you need to know](https://rushter.com/blog/python-garbage-collector/)

How does Python garbage collection work? Why does CPython use reference counting? What problems can a generational garbage collector solve? How can you view and debug reference cycles?

7. [Postgres vs. DynamoDB: Which Database to Choose?](https://testdriven.io/blog/postgres-vs-dynamodb/)

How are **Postgres** and **DynamoDB** used and how should you choose between them? The article compares their ORM, queries, performance, backups, migrations, and provides recommendations for choosing a solution based on different scenarios.

8. [Building a dashboard in Python using Streamlit](https://blog.streamlit.io/crafting-a-dashboard-app-in-python-using-streamlit/)

A detailed official blog tutorial that uses Pandas for data cleaning, Altair/Plotly for data visualization, and Streamlit for the front end.

9. [scrapscript.py](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/scrapscript/)

Scrapscript is a tiny, pure, functional, content-addressable, web-first programming language. The author introduces its design principles, features, implemented and in-progress features, and the process of implementing it with Python.

10. [We build X.509 chains so you don‚Äôt have to](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/01/25/we-build-x-509-chains-so-you-dont-have-to/)

X.509 is a PKI standard that defines the format of digital certificates and standardizes certificate attributes. Version 42.0.0 of **Cryptography** provides X.509 related APIs. The article introduces its significance and the problems it solves.

11. [I am disappointed by dynamic typing](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/i-am-disappointed-by-dynamic-typing/)

The author's disappointment is not about the drawbacks of dynamic typing compared to static typing, but that Python does not take full advantage of the strengths of dynamic typing. Dynamic is not the opposite of static; dynamic means types can change at runtime. The author hopes to enhance the power of dynamic analysis, hoping that "test amplification" of dynamic typing is easier, rather than turning to type annotations or static typing.

12. [Python‚Äôs ‚ÄúDisappointing‚Äù Superpowers](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/pythons-disappointing-superpowers/)

This article is a response to the previous sharing, illustrating the superpowers of Python's dynamic typing through the magical techniques (monkey patching and dynamic metaprogramming) used by libraries such as Werkzeug, Pony, Django, fluent-compile, and Pytest. Python can do more than you might think.
