## ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials

1. [uv: Python packaging in Rust](https://astral.sh/blog/uv)

`Ruff` team developed a powerful tool in Rust: `uv`, a package resolver and installer for Python! It's designed as a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `pip-tools`, and it's 8-10x faster than them when not using a cache. It can also be used as a virtual environment manager via `uv venv`, which is 80x faster than `python -m venv` and 7x faster than `virtualenv`.

2. [Rye: A Vision Continued](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/2/4/rye-a-vision/)

Rye is a Python packaging and project management tool released by the author of Flask in April last year. In the article, the author summarized its implemented functions (downloading Python, managing virtual environments, building and releasing packages, linting and formatting, dependency management, etc.), and introduced his design ideas. (Appendix 1: The author's 16-minute tutorial video [Rye: a Hassle-Free Python Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99TYA7LnuA)) (Appendix 2: The uv team that shared last time has taken over Rye, and it will be integrated into one in the future.

3. [The Python Rust-aissance](https://baincapitalventures.com/insight/why-more-python-developers-are-using-rust-for-building-libraries/)

Rust is progressively replacing C as the high-performance backend for Python. The article introduces the advantages of Rust over C and presents some well-known Python libraries developed with Rust.

4. [A search engine in 80 lines of Python](https://www.alexmolas.com/2024/02/05/a-search-engine-in-80-lines.html)

This article is a bit clickbaity, but the content it introduces is very comprehensive: asynchronous crawlers based on RSS, inverted indexes, search rankings, and web pages based on FastAPI. You can learn how search engines work and learn the project development process from data acquisition, data parsing, open interfaces, to web page presentation.

5. [Counting CPU Instructions in Python](https://blog.mattstuchlik.com/2024/02/08/counting-cpu-instructions-in-python.html)

Do you know how many CPU instructions it takes to execute `print("Hello")` in Python? The answer is 17,000. Importing `seaborn` takes about 2 billion. The author developed the [Cirron](https://github.com/s7nfo/Cirron) library to count CPU instructions, branch misses, and time spent in code.

6. [Python Reusable Decorator Code](https://www.kawabangga.com/posts/5757)

You have multiple decorators to add to different functions, and the same decorator may have different parameters. How do you reuse these decorators? The problem may be difficult to understand at first glance, but the article contains intuitive examples and solutions that can deepen your understanding of decorators and help you master advanced applications.

7. [Handling Tasks in Asyncio Like a Pro](https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/handling-asyncio-tasks)

What is a Task object in Asyncio? How do Asyncio coroutines work? How do you await a task, and how do you await multiple or a group of tasks? This article explains how Asyncio works and the functions you can use to work with tasks.

8. [Everything You Can Do with Python's textwrap Module](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/108)

This article introduces several major functions of the `textwrap` library, such as `shorten()` for truncating string length, `wrap()` for wrapping a string to a fixed width, and `dedent()` for handling string indentation.

9. [Summary of Major Changes Between Python Versions](https://www.nicholashairs.com/posts/major-changes-between-python-versions/)

When were some of Python's new features introduced? The author has conveniently compiled a record of some important changes to the syntax and standard library, as well as indicating when each version will reach its end of life (for example, Python 3.8 will reach EOL in October of this year). (Note: This [website](https://endoflife.date/python) provides EOL dates for Python and many other projects.)

10. [Postgres as a Queue](https://leontrolski.github.io/postgres-as-queue.html)

If you use a database directly as a queue, will performance be significantly affected? The author's tests show that the impact is minimal. How exactly can you implement Postgres as a queue? How do you handle locks and transactions, task retries, and task timeouts?

11. [20 Django Packages That I Use in Every Project](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/20-django-packages-i-use-every-project)

The Django framework is suitable for building complex web projects, and the author introduces 20 commonly used packages that provide richer functionality beyond Django's core features.

12. [Real Case of Python Metaclass Application](https://dev.to/anbagu/real-case-of-python-metaclass-application-2pj8)

What is a metaclass in Python? Why should you learn about metaclasses? This advanced feature is not commonly used, but it's worth learning and understanding. The article explains how metaclasses work and demonstrates their powerful uses with real-world examples.

13. [One Trillion Row Challenge](https://blog.coiled.io/blog/1trc.html)

A programming challenge: given 100,000 files, each with 10 million rows, calculate the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for each weather station. The data is stored on S3 and has a total size of 2.5 TB. The author provides their own implementation (which runs in 8.5 minutes), as well as a cost-optimized solution.
